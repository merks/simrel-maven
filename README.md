# simrel-maven

This repository provides a copy of the [Maven Reports](https://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.incubator.git/tree/maven/org.eclipse.oomph.maven.generator/report) generated by the Oomph Incubator's [Maven Generator](https://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.incubator.git/tree/maven/org.eclipse.oomph.maven.generator).

The following reports are generated from the target platform files of the corresponding [SimRel](https://ci.eclipse.org/simrel/) participants.

- [m2e](m2e/REPORT.md)
- [platform](platform/REPORT.md)
- [tm4e](tm4e/REPORT.md)
- [windowbuilder](windowbuilder/REPORT.md)

The generator copies the *.target file from each project, and extracts the Maven dependencies from each.
It consults the metadata available at Maven central for any available updated versions of each of those dependencies.
From that information, it generates a report and, in addition, generates an updated *.target file with any available minor version updates.

The generator can also generate a merged *.target file from as set of *.target inputs.
In this case, in addition to the above inputs, it also uses this supplementary input:

- [supplement](supplement/REPORT.md)

which then produces this merged target:

- [merged-target](merged-target/REPORT.md)

A [Maven Tycho build](https://ci.eclipse.org/oomph/job/simrel/job/simrel-maven/) effectively combines all the Maven  dependencies into a single feature and builds an update site which resolves all requirement,
thereby testing that the dependencies are transitively complete.
The build then produces a minimal update site of just the direct Maven dependencies, updated to the latest minor version, including the corresponding source bundle of each, and PGP signs all those artifacts.
That update site is published to the following location:

- [https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/simrel-maven/](https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/simrel-maven/)

Making this generator reusable and flexible is a work in progress...
